              <h1> About Me </h1>
              <p>Hello my name is Dioris Diaz I am currently an Operations Manager for a company 
                  that is based in Philadelphia called GoBrands or its better known name Gopuff.
                  I've been working for Gopuff for about a year and a half now, I started as a delivery driver
                  for the company and quickly moved up the ranks and I am now one of the lead managers 
                  of the North-East branch of Gopuff. </p>
                  </table>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p> Aside from working as an Ops manager I am also currently 
                  enrolled in the UPenn LPS Coding BootCamp. I believe that being able to code/programming 
                  is a on of the most useful skills that you can learn in this day in age especially with the rise 
                  of automation and the advances in technology. One of my other intersest is music, I've been
                  playing the guitar since I was a child. I find that its very therapeutic and also extremely fun.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p>
                  I would like to eventually somehow integrate my musical abillties with the coding knowledge that 
                  I am gaining.
              </p>
